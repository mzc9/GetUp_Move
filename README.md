# GetUpnMove


Though this project was created during the web development class as part of my CS degree, we had the freedom to design a web application within the boundaries of the following specfications:

 - Website should have 1 homepage and at least 3 subpages.  Each should have a horizontal menu that leads to other pages
 - Homepage to have a carousel animation
 - There should be scroll box on one of the pages
 - An unordered HTML list with several entries
 - Links to outside pages
 
### Background
For a full time office worker who is also pursuing a college education, the time available is very limited.  If you also live in the snow belt of the Americas, biking is not an option for a large part of the year.  Additionally, life in a small studio translates into “It is not big enough to bring in a treadmill”. So while you may not have big chunks of time, there is an opportunity in short bursts of time that can be used to advantage. 

As a wanna-be dancer, I decided this was my opportunity to get fit like a ballet dancer.  So I collected information over the school break and began working out in my studio apartment.  So, when the web developement project guidelines were presented, I decided to make a website of the resources that I had collected. The ones listed highlight the resources that I have found through online searches, talking with friends who are avid gym clients, my old gym class teacher, and several yoga instructors.
